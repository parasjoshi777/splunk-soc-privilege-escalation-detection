# Project Overview

This project simulates an enterprise SOC use case where Splunk SIEM is used
to detect abnormal privilege escalation behavior on endpoints.

Due to macOS unified logging limitations, the detection logic relies on
behavior-based analysis instead of explicit authentication failure messages.

The project demonstrates SOC analyst skills including detection engineering,
false-positive reduction, investigation, and incident documentation.
